Description: clustSIGNAL: clustering of Spatially Informed Gene expression with Neighbourhood Adapted Learning. 
    A tool for adaptively smoothing and clustering gene expression data. clustSIGNAL uses entropy to measure 
    heterogeneity of cell neighbourhoods and performs a weighted, adaptive smoothing, where homogeneous 
    neighbourhoods are smoothed more and heterogeneous nwighbourhoods are smoothed less. This not only overcomes 
    data sparsity but also incorporates spatial context into the gene expression data. The resulting smoothed gene 
    expression data is used for clustering and could be used for other downstream analyses.
