ClustSIGNAL: ***Clust***ering of ***S***patially ***I***nformed
***G***ene expression with ***N***eighbourhood ***A***dapted
***L***earning.

An R package to perform spatially-informed cell type clustering on
high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data. This method has two-fold
motivation: overcoming data sparsity by using neighbourhood
heterogeneity information to guide an adaptive smoothing approach, and
performing spatially-informed clustering by embedding spatial context
into the gene expression. To achieve these, we calculate entropy as a
measure of heterogeneity of cell neighbourhoods and use it to generate
weight distributions and perform adaptive smoothing of gene expression.
Homogeneous neighbourhoods generally have low entropy, and so, smoothing
is performed over more cells in these neighbourhoods. Contrarily,
heterogeneous neighbourhoods have high entropy and are smoothed over a
much smaller region. The resulting adaptively smoothed gene expression
is used for clustering.

## Method description

![](reference/figures/Fig1_schematic.jpg)

**Figure: ClustSIGNAL method overview.**

Here, we present ClustSIGNAL, a spatial clustering method developed to
handle data sparsity while considering the variability in cell
arrangement of tissue regions. The core steps involved in the method are
sequential:

**1.** The method starts with non-spatial clustering and subclustering
(default louvain clustering) to classify cells into clusters and
subclusters that we refer to as ‘initial clusters’ and ‘initial
subclusters’, respectively.

**2.** The neighbourhood of each cell is then defined in terms of
initial subcluster composition.

**3.** The cells in the neighbourhood are also sorted and rearranged so
that the neighbours belonging to the same initial clusters as the index
cell are placed closer to it.

**4.** Neighbourhood heterogeneity is measured as entropy, where a high
entropy value indicates more heterogeneity in the neighbourhood and a
low entropy value indicates a more homogeneous neighbourhood.

**5.** The entropy values are used to generate weight distributions
specific to each neighbourhood.

**6.** The gene expressions of cells are adaptively smoothed using the
entropy-guided weight distributions; cells in heterogeneous
neighbourhoods (high entropy regions) undergo smoothing over a smaller
region, whereas cells in homogeneous neighbourhoods (low entropy
regions) undergo smoothing over a larger region.

**7.** Non-spatial clustering is performed with adaptively smoothed gene
expression to generate ClustSIGNAL clusters.

## ClustSIGNAL parameters

ClustSIGNAL package uses a SpatialExperiment object as input. We provide
users with a number of parameters to explore and experiment with, as
well as prior tested default values for quick runs. ClustSIGNAL can be
used for single sample or multisample analysis with just one function
call. Below is the list of the parameters offered and their possible
values:

- **spe** - SpatialExperiment object with cell spatial coordinates and
  normalized gene expression in it.

- **samples** - column name in cell metadata of the spe object that
  contains sample names.

- **dimRed** - dimensionality reduction method name in reduced
  dimensions of the spe object. Default value is “None”, in which case
  PCA is calculated and used as low dimension data.

- **batch** - whether batch correction should be performed. Default
  value is False.

- **batch_by** - column name in cell metadata of the spe object
  containing the groups by which to perform batch correction. By
  default, batch_by is set to “None”. If the batch option is set to
  True, the batch_by value must be changed to the group name to perform
  batch correction.

- **NN** - neighbourhood size in terms of the number of nearest
  neighbours to consider. Value should be \> 1. Default value is 30.

- **kernel** - type of weight distribution to use. Can be Gaussian
  (default) or exponential distribution.

- **spread** - value of distribution parameter - standard deviation of
  Gaussian distribution or rate of exponential distribution. Default
  value is 0.3, recommended for Gaussian distribution. For exponential
  distribution, recommended value is 5.

- **sort** - whether cell neighbourhoods should be sorted by their
  initial cluster labels. Default value is True.

- **threads** - number of cpus to use for parallel runs. Default value
  is 1.

- **outputs** - choice of output types. Default value is ‘c’ for a list
  containing data frame of cell IDs and ClustSIGNAL cluster labels.
  Other possible values are “n” for a list of ClustSIGNAL clusters
  dataframe and neighbourhood matrix, “s” for a list of ClustSIGNAL
  clusters dataframe and final SpatialExperiment object, and “a” for a
  list of all 3 outputs - ClustSIGNAL clusters dataframe, neighbourhood
  matrix, and final spe object.

- **clustParams** - parameter options for TwoStepParam clustering
  methods in the bluster package. The clustering parameters are in the
  following order in this list:

  - ***clust_c*** represents number of centers for clustering with
    KmeansParam. By default this is set to 0, in which case the method
    uses either 5000 centers or 1/5th of the total cells in the data as
    the number of centers, whichever is lower.

  - ***subclust_c*** represents number of centers for sub-clustering the
    initial clusters with KmeansParam. The default value is 0, in which
    case the method uses either 1 center or half of the total cells in
    the initial cluster as the number of centers, whichever is higher.

  - ***iter.max*** for the maximum number of iterations to perform
    during clustering and subclustering with KmeansParam. Default value
    is 30.

  - ***k*** indicates the k-value used for clustering/subclustering with
    NNGraphParam. Default value is 10.

  - ***cluster.fun*** is the graph clustering method used with
    NNGraphParam. By default, the Louvain method is used.

## Running ClustSIGNAL

Before running ClustSIGNAL, it is important to ensure that the input
SpatialExperiment object has spatial coordinates stored in the
spatialCoords matrix. Otherwise, the method will throw an error asking
the user to provide spatial coordinates.

``` r
# load required packages
library(clustSIGNAL)

data(ClustSignal_example)

# Here, the sample labels are in 'sample_id' column.
res <- clustSIGNAL(spe, samples = "sample_id", outputs = "a")
```

# Package index
